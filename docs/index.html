            <p class="lead">Routinemaker generates formatted Excel spreadsheets. You can either print out the spreadsheets or upload them to the cloud (ie: Google Drive) to make them easier to use during workouts. Below are screenshots, downloadable files, and a brief usage guide for sample routines.</p>
            <h6>Strength (<a href="xlsx/strength.xlsx" target="_blank">download</a>)</h6>
            <p><em>Usage:</em> On Day 1, do 2 sets of 5 reps of dumbbell goblet squats with 50 pounds of weight, then do 2 sets of 3 reps of barbell bench presses with 20 pounds of weight. Mark an "X" in the corresponding white box as you finish each set.</p>

            <h6>Cardio (<a href="xlsx/cardio.xlsx" target="_blank">download</a>)</h6>
            <p><em>Usage:</em> On Day 1, run for 2.5 minutes, then rest by walking. Next, run for 1.5 minutes, then rest by walking. Finish all 6 intervals and mark an "X" in the corresponding white box as you progress.</p>
            <img src="img/cardio.png" class="img-fluid mb-4">
            <h6>HIIT (<a href="xlsx/HIIT.xlsx" target="_blank">download</a>)</h6>
            <p><em>Usage:</em> On Day 1, do 2 sets of 9 reps of bodyweight side lunges for each side, then do 2 sets of 5 reps of bodyweight jump squats, then do 2 sets of 10-second bodyweight forearm planks. Mark an "X" in the corresponding white box as you finish each set.</p>

            <h3>Customizations</h3>
            <p class="lead">Routinemake is meant to be customized to your preferences. In particular, you may want to modify the list of exercises or tweak the equations for the curves used to generate the workouts.</p>
            <h6>Exercises</h6>
            <p>You can customize the list of exercises that Routinemaker uses to generate workouts. The exercises are stored in <code>data/exercises.json</code>. Each exercise in the json file includes settings for <em>type</em> (ie: strength), muscle <em>group</em> (ie: chest), <em>variations</em> (ie: by equipment), <em>unit</em> of measurement (ie: reps or seconds), <em>minimum</em> units, <em>maximum</em> units, and the <em>step</em> for incrementing the units.</p>
            <h6>Curves</h6>
            <p>You can also customize the curves that Routinemaker uses to generate workouts. The calculation logic is stored in <code>routine.py</code>. Routinemaker comes with 3 default curves: <em>linear</em> (constant increase in difficulty), <em>exponential</em> (starts off easy and escalates in difficulty towards the end), and <em>logarithmic</em> (ramps up quickly).</p>

            <h3>Workflow</h3>
            <p class="lead">Routinemaker works by prompting for a variety of settings and then feeding the parameters into curves in order to generate workouts for each day. Below are a few sample screenshots of the workflow and a summary of all the prompts and options.</p>
